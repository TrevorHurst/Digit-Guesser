# Digit-Guesser
Run `python app.py` and navigate to the server location to draw digits and have a neural network guess what they are!

This program uses a very simple feed-forward neural network powered by pytorch.

I trained 20 EPOCHs on my GTX1080 to net.pth.
You can run net.py and adjust values to make it more or less fit.
As it currently sits, it seems the AI is over-fit to the MNIST dataset, I will re-implement this with a more robust network to see the results
This is just meant to demonstrate a consept I'm well aware the code is awful!

Thanks for reading!
